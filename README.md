# Portfolio

In this repository there are some notebooks where I show my skills as a data scientist. I rely on two Kaggle competitions (Titanic and House Prices) and also include an exercise that I undertook based on a dataset that seeks to elucidate the relationship between academic performance and social factors.
Also, I'm updating a folder named "Python Projects" with small projects where I show my coding skills.
